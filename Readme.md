## Introduction

The Advisor Dashboard is a LTI tool in canvas that allows Professional and Faculty advisers to view an overview of grades, assignments and attendance of all students and their courses in current semester. This tool appears as a separate course site in the canvas of professional and faculty advisers and is not visible to students or general faculty. Because student information is protected under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), only professional and faculty advisers have access to this tool. 


## Requirements
- Canvas
- EduAppCenter
- CSV file mapping Advisor(SIS ID) and Student(SIS ID)
## Integration

> **Note:**
